# WebAcademy
WebAcademy is an internal learning platform that centralizes two things:

1) **Learning Requests Workflow**: employees request paid/academy-managed learning resources, the Academy approves/rejects, Finance provides payment setup and verifies proof. All tracked as a single request record (no more scattered email threads).

2) **Learning Content Hub**: employees and the Academy publish and discover reusable learning content (resources + learning paths) so learning experiences can be reused.

For the full product requirements and scope, see: [docs/requirements.md](./docs/requirements.md).
